# Spooky-Author-Identification
> Spooky Author Identification: > This project uses Apache Spark and machine learning to identify the author of sentences from works by Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, and Mary Shelley. The goal is to build a text classification pipeline that predicts the author of each sentence using natural language processing and supervised learning techniques.
